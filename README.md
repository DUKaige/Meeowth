Meeowth is a computational algebra system on iOS with powerful calculation capability. It includes necessary tools for both symbolic and numeric computation. The convenient graphical interface makes Meeowth really easy to use.


Meeowth is currently capable of 
· calculating the values of any valid expressions;
·	plotting graphs of valid single-variable functions;
·	plotting 3D graphs of valid single-variable or double-variable functions;
·	solving polynomial equations in the real domain;
·	differentiating real functions symbolically;
·	expanding and simplifying functions;
·	factorizing polynomials with rational coefficients in Galois Field.


Key features:
· Modules can be dragged in the main interface.
· Specially made math keyboards include all the necessary functions.
· Users are allowed to save their work.
